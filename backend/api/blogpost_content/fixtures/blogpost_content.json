Also, they are the most expensive housing option, as they&rsquo;re owned by the school. I only lived in the dorms for 1 year, but I enjoyed that time as I felt like I got to experience living with many other students and building relationships with people down the hall.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Housing Option #2: Apartments</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">If you&rsquo;re looking for housing that is cheaper than the dorms, apartments are a great option. Apartments also enable you to have a personal kitchen where you can freely cook and store your food and groceries, and you have the space to arrange and decorate your apartment however you like.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Most apartments don&rsquo;t come with any furniture, though, so you&rsquo;ll need to get your own bed, desk, chair, lamp, cooking supplies, and anything else you&rsquo;ll need in the apartment. You&rsquo;ll also need to provide and set up your own utilities, which include internet, electricity, water and gas, and also get renter&rsquo;s insurance. Some rental agreements come with some of the utilities included in your rent, so it&rsquo;s good to ask the landlord what&rsquo;s included in your contract before deciding on an apartment.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Unlike dorms, most apartments also aren&rsquo;t close to campus. Usually, the closer an apartment is to campus, the more expensive it is, and the cheaper options are farther away from campus. If you choose to live in an apartment that&rsquo;s farther away from campus, make sure you think about how you&rsquo;ll get to campus - whether it&rsquo;s walkable, or if there&rsquo;s a bus that stops nearby that can take you to campus.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"border: none; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 419px; height: 279px;\"><img style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OzOvGhm4w9nLY1wq3C_OE63c7sHJNqUmmVAbAUrqr0sWDo9Ii47jW2eGW_ivhZlvf4RfKsLctq-4Fttbozrwl_6Fn-GWzgjeKkS1roAS9lSn6lJ_pukDnXDbNRakwR4iYWaezdA\" alt=\"Apartment.

You can ask friends or classmates you get along with. You can also find other students already living in an apartment that are searching for roommates and ask to join their apartment. Some students will post that they&rsquo;re looking for apartments on social media such as Facebook group posts.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Housing Option #3: Homestay</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"border: none; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 470px; height: 314px;\"><img style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uDpjggEWORZ2xU_NqK67efH5m0cPblFllNDlCL0gOdx8CXYANDEZcSrqFX6tG2mR7JVS3YqEtqEieat7I9tCAYnR66kenvgavCXtKE3LynvLa-t0cuYh2n2199DS61x7bJlhRQY\" alt=\"Food on table.

Each homestay is different depending on the family that you get to stay with. Some will just provide you with a room, while others allow you to be a part of the family where you can eat together with your host family. Some homestay options end up being cheaper because they can include meals and laundry.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Another benefit of homestay is that it enables you to get a cultural experience of living with a local family, and you can practice speaking English at home with your host family every day. Keep in mind that when you live with a host family, you can&rsquo;t just do whatever you want in the house. You&rsquo;ll have to follow the rules and expectations of the host family like if you&rsquo;ll have to come home by a certain time, or if you&rsquo;ll have to help out around the house with chores.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Keep in mind that homestays are also typically located farther away from campus, so if you don&rsquo;t have a car, you&rsquo;ll have to work out details on how you&rsquo;ll get to campus each day with your homestay host.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">If you&rsquo;re an exchange student or someone that&rsquo;s only going to stay in America for a short time like from 2 weeks to 6 months, this is a good option to consider because you won&rsquo;t need to sign a long housing/rental contract.

Don&rsquo;t sit on the couch or your bed because you&rsquo;ll naturally want to fall asleep. (Each time I work on the couch, I just want to take a nap.) It&rsquo;s good to sit at a table or desk where you can concentrate and be in working mode. I generally like to be in a space where it&rsquo;s clean, quiet, and clutter-free so that I can best concentrate on my work.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tip #3: Minimize distractions</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"border: none; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 445px; height: 296px;\"><img style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Z5QEMCP7_njb3F2m2iWyE8iVFd0GHeN6YqUPfowOr_s13UjF4QjHGgoC3Sf8zRPbGE5RZ9e-eLXHIht44ooiCyO9fT2lYCiB2OId6BwvPAZyC-Hii_Q6dvuJ7v0Okl86etLdU7Y\" alt=\"Texting.

You&rsquo;ll avoid constantly seeing texts or messages that can draw your attention away as you try to focus on your online class. And I know it&rsquo;s hard, but close other tabs on your browser so that you&rsquo;re not checking Facebook, Instagram, or the news as your professor is trying to teach the lecture. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to put your phone on silent so that you&rsquo;re not constantly hearing your ringtone or buzzing sounds from your phone. I personally like to put my phone away or place it face down so that I don&rsquo;t see the screen light up with each notification that comes in.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tip #4: Take breaks</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"border: none; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 406px; height: 270px;\"><img style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sKR5tEeaQc54sIqqnwaan4fCO68gojJzHRQ8SkBtKOtOh_yfIQbrmT-Jp7EZ13gGjcWYPVmBF_cr2Hi41YHyls4zBE4ncaVF_AA__lfm-_yCTwPhT1GLxnQ47tLIXODRpH69YnU\" alt=\"Jogging.Photo credit: Arek Adeoye on unsplash.com\" width=\"406\" height=\"270\" /></span></span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Photo credit: Arek Adeoye on unsplash.com</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It&rsquo;s tiring watching lecture after lecture or always doing your homework. Generally, for every one hour of work you put in, it&rsquo;s good to give yourself a 10-minute break. You can take a break by going outside, going on a walk, stretching, grabbing a snack, reading a book or article. This will help refresh your mind. As humans, we&rsquo;re not wired to work for long periods of time without breaks. We need to give our minds and brains a break from focusing on one thing. This will help you to think more clearly and look at the problem you&rsquo;ve been trying to solve or the paper you&rsquo;re trying to write from a new perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tip #5: Set a schedule</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"border: none; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 538px; height: 326px;\"><img style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4exkTbp9lqXA87xYPnceDqE3op4eGCoJ56SLyvzCc5qR56yrrjW7rPMRjxjNB9OAGR9zSrEV5q0m_AAO-nfHg6k9RfradKJNTomtOUAbZSzBaXV8yuaqdkRL6jJUVupjMoR7VgY\" alt=\"Calendar\" width=\"538\" height=\"326\" /></span></span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Stick to a regular weekly schedule by setting aside the hours where you&rsquo;ll attend class and study. It&rsquo;s also good to set a time for when you&rsquo;ll take your breaks. You should also limit how long your break will be so that you don&rsquo;t end up spending five hours playing video games or watching Korean dramas </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">😱.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Some ways to keep track of your time is to set a timer on your phone or computer that alerts you when time is up. You can also create your weekly schedule using Google Calendar to plan out each hour of your days. If you don&rsquo;t like using online scheduling apps like Google Calendar, writing out your schedule the good old fashion way using pen and paper in a planner is also a good idea. I personally like to write my schedule on a mini whiteboard for my desk.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It&rsquo;s also a good idea to schedule important dates in your calendar. This includes midterms, finals, due dates of papers, and any vacation or travel plans you have coming up. This will help you remember what&rsquo;s to come. I&rsquo;ve had some friends forget that they had a midterm on the day of the test, and so they weren&rsquo;t prepared to take it. I&rsquo;ve also had friends who just didn&rsquo;t show up to their test because they forgot about it. Scheduling things in is key.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Need more help focusing on your classes?
