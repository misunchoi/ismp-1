I wanted to have an extraordinary college experience, happily pursuing my college degree. Halfway through my freshman year, things took a turn.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I made connections and added people on social media, but I didn&rsquo;t have a true friend who knew me well. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was connecting with others. On a lonely night, I attended an outdoor concert with my roommates, even though I didn&rsquo;t care for the music my roommates enjoyed. In that moment, I felt lonely. </span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I experienced loneliness as a domestic student. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve also experienced loneliness back in your home country as well. International students are more likely to experience loneliness and isolation when they move to their new home in a foreign country.&nbsp; Adjusting to a new culture and language is obviously challenging. But even ordinary activities, such as grocery shopping and going to the doctor, become strangely complex and remind international students that living abroad is not easy. On top of that, international students must make new friends and face the pressures of performing well in school, so it&rsquo;s easy to feel overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">What can we do about this problem of loneliness?

To meet other people who share your interests, you can explore your college&rsquo;s interest groups. You can start building relationships before you arrive in the US. You can even make a social media group of students from your home country as a way to get to know each other better. If you&rsquo;ve already made some friendships, your college experience will be even better once you&rsquo;ve arrived. You can check out our ISMP social media websites and our WeChat to make connections with our mentors and other mentees.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I joined a college campus group during my freshman year.

You&rsquo;ll avoid constantly seeing texts or messages that can draw your attention away as you try to focus on your online class. And I know it&rsquo;s hard, but close other tabs on your browser so that you&rsquo;re not checking Facebook, Instagram, or the news as your professor is trying to teach the lecture. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to put your phone on silent so that you&rsquo;re not constantly hearing your ringtone or buzzing sounds from your phone. I personally like to put my phone away or place it face down so that I don&rsquo;t see the screen light up with each notification that comes in.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tip #4: Take breaks</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"border: none; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 406px; height: 270px;\"><img style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\" src=\"https://ismp-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/blogpost-assets/online_class_tips/jogging.png\" alt=\"Jogging.Photo credit: Arek Adeoye on unsplash.com\" width=\"406\" height=\"270\" /></span></span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Photo credit: Arek Adeoye on unsplash.com</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It&rsquo;s tiring watching lecture after lecture or always doing your homework. Generally, for every one hour of work you put in, it&rsquo;s good to give yourself a 10-minute break. You can take a break by going outside, going on a walk, stretching, grabbing a snack, reading a book or article. This will help refresh your mind. As humans, we&rsquo;re not wired to work for long periods of time without breaks. We need to give our minds and brains a break from focusing on one thing. This will help you to think more clearly and look at the problem you&rsquo;ve been trying to solve or the paper you&rsquo;re trying to write from a new perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tip #5: Set a schedule</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"border: none; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 538px; height: 326px;\"><img style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\" src=\"https://ismp-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/blogpost-assets/online_class_tips/calendar.png\" alt=\"Calendar\" width=\"538\" height=\"326\" /></span></span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Stick to a regular weekly schedule by setting aside the hours where you&rsquo;ll attend class and study. It&rsquo;s also good to set a time for when you&rsquo;ll take your breaks. You should also limit how long your break will be so that you don&rsquo;t end up spending five hours playing video games or watching Korean dramas </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">😱.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Some ways to keep track of your time is to set a timer on your phone or computer that alerts you when time is up. You can also create your weekly schedule using Google Calendar to plan out each hour of your days. If you don&rsquo;t like using online scheduling apps like Google Calendar, writing out your schedule the good old fashion way using pen and paper in a planner is also a good idea. I personally like to write my schedule on a mini whiteboard for my desk.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It&rsquo;s also a good idea to schedule important dates in your calendar. This includes midterms, finals, due dates of papers, and any vacation or travel plans you have coming up. This will help you remember what&rsquo;s to come. I&rsquo;ve had some friends forget that they had a midterm on the day of the test, and so they weren&rsquo;t prepared to take it. I&rsquo;ve also had friends who just didn&rsquo;t show up to their test because they forgot about it. Scheduling things in is key.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Need more help focusing on your classes?

I wanted to have an extraordinary college experience, happily pursuing my college degree. Halfway through my freshman year, things took a turn.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I made connections and added people on social media, but I didn&rsquo;t have a true friend who knew me well. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was connecting with others. On a lonely night, I attended an outdoor concert with my roommates, even though I didn&rsquo;t care for the music my roommates enjoyed. In that moment, I felt lonely. </span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I experienced loneliness as a domestic student. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve also experienced loneliness back in your home country as well. International students are more likely to experience loneliness and isolation when they move to their new home in a foreign country.&nbsp; Adjusting to a new culture and language is obviously challenging. But even ordinary activities, such as grocery shopping and going to the doctor, become strangely complex and remind international students that living abroad is not easy. On top of that, international students must make new friends and face the pressures of performing well in school, so it&rsquo;s easy to feel overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">What can we do about this problem of loneliness?

To meet other people who share your interests, you can explore your college&rsquo;s interest groups. You can start building relationships before you arrive in the US. You can even make a social media group of students from your home country as a way to get to know each other better.

You might feel like you have to work hard and that others expect you to do well. If you&rsquo;re under a lot of pressure, it&rsquo;s crucial to ask for help when you need it.
